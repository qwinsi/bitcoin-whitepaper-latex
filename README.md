# LaTeX Reproduction of the Bitcoin Whitepaper

This repository contains a LaTeX version of the Bitcoin whitepaper.

## Introduction

The Bitcoin whitepaper, one of the most important documents in the history of cryptocurrencies,
was published in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, available at https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf .

As far as I know, there is no official LaTeX version of the Bitcoin whitepaper available.
This repository contains LaTeX files which reproduce the Bitcoin whitepaper.

This LaTeX project is aimed to be a good example for LaTeX learners
to learn how to write a LaTeX document with mathematical formulas and TiKZ pictures.

## Known Issues

- The size of each part may look different from the original whitepaper.
- The TiKZ pictures do not fit the page width well.
- References are not exactly the same as the original whitepaper.

## Thanks

Special thanks to [TeXiFy IDEA](https://github.com/Hannah-Sten/TeXiFy-IDEA) for making it easy to write LaTeX in a JetBrains IDE.
